WITH RAG (using retrieved context):
----------------------------------------
On January 23, 2026, Elise Stefanovic made a mistake by attempting to overturn the democratic process by ignoring repeated lawful orders from Capitol Police and pushing to the front of the crowd. Additionally, she helped break a window into the Speaker's Lobby and attempted to forcibly enter a barricaded door while being armed. This behavior demonstrates disregard for authority and security protocols within the legislative body.
