The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is a non-profit organization that advocates on behalf of civil liberties, human rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, immigrants' rights, the poor, prisoners' rights, and people with disabilities. They have been vocal in their opposition to funding abortion providers because they believe it infringes upon the right to privacy.
The ACLU has also been vocal in its support of funding of pregnancy centers. In 2014, the group filed an amicus brief supporting the use of federal funds to provide services at pregnancy centers. This was done as part of a broader effort by the ACLU to protect access to reproductive health care.

In summary, while the ACLU opposes funding of abortion providers due to concerns about privacy and autonomy, they are supportive of funding of pregnancy centers. Their stance on these issues reflects their overall advocacy for civil liberties and reproductive rights.
