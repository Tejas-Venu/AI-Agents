Where does the frontier model's general knowledge succeed?
The frontier model’s general knowledge succeeds on broadly documented, historical, or mechanical questions such as Model T maintenance (carburetor adjustment, spark plug gap, transmission band tightening, oil type). These are well-established topics that are likely covered in training data and do not require access to a specific proprietary document. It also appropriately declined to fabricate details about future 2026 congressional events.

When did the frontier model appear to be using live web search to help answer your questions?
There is no clear indication that live web search was used. The responses to the 2026 congressional questions explicitly referenced a knowledge cutoff and declined to provide post-2023 information, which suggests the model relied solely on pretraining rather than real-time retrieval.

Where does your RAG system provide more accurate, specific answers?
The RAG system provides more accurate and specific answers when questions require precise details from a particular source, such as the Model T manual or exact Congressional Record entries. In those cases, retrieval grounds the answer in the actual text, reducing hallucination and increasing factual precision.

What does this tell you about when RAG adds value vs. when a powerful model suffices?
This comparison shows that powerful frontier models are often sufficient for general knowledge and widely documented topics. However, RAG adds significant value when answering domain-specific, document-specific, or time-sensitive questions that are not reliably stored in pretraining data. In short, general knowledge favors large models, while specialized or corpus-specific tasks benefit strongly from RAG.
