Does GPT-4o Mini do a better job than Qwen 2.5 1.5B in avoiding hallucinations?
Yes. GPT-4o Mini avoids fabricating specific events in the 2026 questions and instead clearly states its knowledge cutoff (October 2023), whereas the smaller Qwen 2.5 1.5B model previously generated detailed but incorrect claims and invented facts. While GPT-4o Mini still gives a likely incorrect description of the Main Street Parity Act, it is generally more cautious and significantly less prone to confident hallucination about unknown future events.

Which questions does GPT-4o Mini answer correctly? Compare the cut-off date of GPT-4o Mini pre-training and the age of the Model T Ford and Congressional Record corpora.
GPT-4o Mini correctly handles the 2026 questions about Mr. Flood and Elise Stefanovic by refusing to fabricate post-2023 events, which aligns with its October 2023 knowledge cutoff. Its answer about congressional debate over pregnancy center funding is broadly plausible but generic, while its explanation of the Main Street Parity Act appears incorrect. Since GPT-4o Mini’s training cutoff is October 2023, it predates 2026 Congressional Record content but postdates historical materials like the Model T Ford era (1908–1927) and most of the long-standing Congressional Record archive, meaning it could have been trained on historical congressional data but not future proceedings.
