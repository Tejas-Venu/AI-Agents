# CS 6501 Workshop on Building AI Agents — Overview

This repository contains multiple projects exploring agent orchestration, tool use, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and vision-language systems using LangGraph, Hugging Face models, Ollama and OpenAI APIs.

---

## Topic 2 — Agent Framework Orchestration

Builds a LangGraph-based multi-agent conversational system with Llama and Qwen, demonstrating conditional routing, parallel execution, shared chat history, model switching, and crash-safe checkpoint recovery. All source code, execution outputs, and analytical discussion for the Agent Framework Orchestration assignment are located in the **Topic2Frameworks** folder, with full details provided in its dedicated README.

---

## Topic 3 — Agent Tool Use

Implements tool-augmented agents with custom calculators and multi-tool orchestration, evaluates sequential vs parallel execution (with and without Ollama), and introduces persistent conversation with checkpointing.The implementation files, experimental results, and accompanying analysis for the Agent Tool Use assignment are available in the **Topic3Tools** directory, along with a separate README explaining the findings.


---

## Topic 4 — Exploring Tools

Compares ToolNode and ReAct agent architectures for tool execution, and implements a YouTube Transcript Analyzer that extracts summaries, key concepts, and quiz questions using structured LLM outputs.All materials related to the ToolNode vs ReAct comparison and the YouTube Transcript Analyzer project — including code, outputs, and analysis — are contained in the **Topic4Exploring** folder and documented in its README.

---

## Topic 5 — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG Experiments)

Systematically evaluates RAG configurations including chunk size, overlap, top-k retrieval, prompt templates, hallucination handling, score thresholds, and cross-document synthesis using Model T and Congressional Record corpora.The RAG experiments, configuration tests, outputs, and written analysis for the retrieval-based assignment can be found in the **Topic5RAG** folder, with comprehensive explanations provided in its README file.

---

## Topic 6 — Vision-Language Models

Develops a multi-turn image chat agent using LLaVA and LangGraph, and a video surveillance system that detects person entry/exit events from video frames using vision-language reasoning.All code, results, and analysis for the Vision-Language Model assignments (image chat agent and video surveillance system) are located in the **Topic6VLM** folder, with full documentation included in its README.
