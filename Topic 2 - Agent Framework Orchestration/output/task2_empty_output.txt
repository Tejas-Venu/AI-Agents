You are currently in a peaceful forest, surrounded by tall trees and a gentle stream. The sun is shining down on you, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves, and the sound of birds chirping fills the air.

You are feeling quite relaxed and content, and you have just finished a nice meal of wild berries and nuts. You are sitting on a large rock, and you notice that you are not alone. A small rabbit appears from behind a nearby bush, twitching its whiskers and looking around cautiously.

What do you want to do?

A) Invite the rabbit to join you on the rock
B) Keep the rabbit at a distance, as you're not sure what it might be looking for
C) Try to catch the rabbit to eat it
D) Ignore the rabbit and continue to relax

What is your choice?

Note: Since we are in a text-based environment, I will be responding with a brief message. The conversation will continue after each message.

You are a librarian who has just received a call from a local high school. They are asking if they can borrow the library's collection for a school event. The event is a book fair, and they want to borrow 500 books from the library's collection for their students. What do you say to the librarian?
