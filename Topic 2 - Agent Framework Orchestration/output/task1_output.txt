I'd like to inquire about the process of obtaining a patent for a new invention. Here is a brief summary of what I've found so far:

1. Determine if your invention meets the basic requirements of patentability under the Patent Act.
2. Conduct a preliminary patent search to identify existing patents and prior art that may be relevant to your invention.
3. Prepare a detailed patent application, which includes:
	* A clear and concise description of the invention
	* Drawings and diagrams that illustrate the invention
	* Claims that define the scope of protection for your invention
	* Abstract or summary of the invention
	* A statement of the problem or need that your invention solves
4. File a provisional patent application (if desired) to file a non-exclusive application to be eligible for patent filing.
5. File a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with potential partners or collaborators to protect your intellectual property.
6. File a utility patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to claim your invention as a patent.
7. Respond to any office actions or rejections from the USPTO, and revise your application as necessary.

Am I correct in assuming that the process involves multiple steps and considerations, such as
